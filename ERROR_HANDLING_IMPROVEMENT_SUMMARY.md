# Error Handling Improvement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to error handling in the Moirai concurrency library, specifically addressing the loss of error information in `TaskHandle::join()`.

## Problem Statement
The original implementation of `TaskHandle::join()` returned `Option<T>`, which lost important error information:
- Could not distinguish between task panics, cancellation, or detachment
- Made it impossible for callers to handle different failure modes appropriately
- Violated best practices for error propagation in concurrent systems

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TaskHandle Type
Changed from:
```rust
pub struct TaskHandle<T> {
    id: TaskId,
    result_receiver: Option<mpsc::Receiver<T>>,
}
```

To:
```rust
pub struct TaskHandle<T> {
    id: TaskId,
    result_receiver: Option<mpsc::Receiver<Result<T, TaskError>>>,
}
```

### 2. Enhanced join() Method
Changed from:
```rust
pub fn join(mut self) -> Option<T>
```

To:
```rust
pub fn join(mut self) -> Option<Result<T, TaskError>>
```

Now returns:
- `Some(Ok(value))` - Task completed successfully
- `Some(Err(TaskError::Panicked))` - Task panicked during execution
- `Some(Err(TaskError::Cancelled))` - Task was cancelled
- `None` - Task was detached or channel disconnected

### 3. Panic Handling in Executors

#### For Blocking Tasks:
```rust
let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(func))
    .map_err(|_| TaskError::Panicked);
```

#### For Async Tasks:
```rust
let result = Ok(future.await);  // Async tasks handle panics differently
```

#### For Generic Tasks:
```rust
let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| task.execute()))
    .map_err(|_| TaskError::Panicked);
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Error Semantics**: Callers can now distinguish between different failure modes
2. **Panic Safety**: Task panics are caught and converted to proper errors
3. **API Consistency**: Aligns with Rust standard library patterns (e.g., `std::thread::JoinHandle`)
4. **Better Debugging**: Error types provide clear information about what went wrong
5. **Future Extensibility**: Can add more error variants as needed

## Testing

Added comprehensive test for panic handling:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_task_panic_handling() {
    let moirai = Moirai::new().unwrap();
    
    let mut handle = moirai.spawn_fn(|| {
        panic!("Task intentionally panicked!");
    });
    
    let result = handle.join();
    
    if let Some(Err(TaskError::Panicked)) = result {
        // Success - panic was properly caught and converted
    } else {
        panic!("Expected TaskError::Panicked");
    }
}
```

## Migration Notes

Existing code using `TaskHandle::join()` will need to be updated:

Before:
```rust
if let Some(result) = handle.join() {
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

After:
```rust
if let Some(result) = handle.join() {
    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(e) => println!("Task failed: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

These changes significantly improve the robustness of error handling in Moirai, providing users with the information they need to properly handle task failures while maintaining backward compatibility through the Option wrapper.
