## 🚀 **Major Achievements This Phase**

### 1. ✅ Dead Code Elimination (SPC + Atomicity)
**Objective**: Resolve TaskPerformanceMetrics unused field warnings
**Achievement**: Complete implementation of all performance metrics fields

**Technical Implementation**:
- **TaskPerformanceMetrics Enhancement**: Added comprehensive methods for all fields
  - `execution_time()`: Calculate total execution time from task start
  - `memory_growth()`: Determine memory growth since task initialization
  - `was_preempted()`: Check if task experienced preemption during execution
  - `update()`: Update metrics with current memory usage
  - `increment_preemption()`: Track preemption events with timestamp updates

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- **Proper Field Utilization**: All struct fields (`memory_start_bytes`, `preemption_count`, `start_time`) now actively used
- **Method Integration**: Enhanced `monitor_task_memory()` to use new `update()` method
- **Performance Logging**: Added threshold-based logging for high-impact tasks (>100ms, >1MB memory, preempted)
- **Work-Stealing Integration**: Added preemption tracking when tasks are stolen between workers

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Production Monitoring (FIRST + CUPID)
**Objective**: Advanced task performance analysis and debugging capabilities
**Achievement**: Comprehensive task lifecycle monitoring with actionable insights

**Monitoring Enhancements**:
- **Real-time Memory Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of task memory usage with peak detection
