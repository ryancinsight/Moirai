# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Rust Hybrid Concurrency Library - "Moirai"

### 1. Executive Summary

**Project Name:** Moirai  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Type:** Pure Standard Library Rust Concurrency Framework  

Moirai is a next-generation concurrency library that synthesizes the best principles from async task scheduling (Tokio-inspired) and parallel work-stealing (Rayon-inspired) into a unified, zero-cost abstraction framework. Named after the Greek Fates who controlled the threads of life, Moirai weaves together async and parallel execution models. Built entirely on Rust's standard library, it leverages Rust's ownership model, zero-cost abstractions, and iterator combinators to deliver unprecedented performance and memory efficiency.

### 2. Vision & Objectives

**Vision:** Create the most efficient, ergonomic, and safe concurrency library for Rust that seamlessly blends asynchronous and parallel execution models.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Achieve zero-cost abstractions with compile-time optimizations
- Provide unified API for async/await and parallel execution
- Implement work-stealing scheduler with intelligent load balancing
- Enable seamless IPC and Multi-Producer Multi-Consumer (MPMC) communication
- Maintain memory safety without sacrificing performance
- Support both CPU-bound and I/O-bound workloads efficiently

### 3. Core Principles & Design Philosophy

#### 3.1 Elite Programming Practices Integration

**CUPID (Composable, Unix Philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-centric):**
- Composable: Modular components that can be combined in various ways
- Unix Philosophy: Small, focused modules that do one thing well
- Predictable: Consistent behavior across all components
- Idiomatic: Follows Rust best practices and conventions
- Domain-centric: Designed specifically for concurrency challenges

**SOLID Principles:**
- Single Responsibility: Each module handles one aspect of concurrency
- Open/Closed: Extensible without modifying core components
- Liskov Substitution: Interchangeable executor implementations
- Interface Segregation: Minimal, focused trait definitions
- Dependency Inversion: Abstract over concrete implementations

**GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns):**
- Information Expert: Components own their relevant data
- Creator: Clear ownership patterns for resource creation
- Controller: Centralized coordination of complex operations
- Low Coupling: Minimal dependencies between modules
- High Cohesion: Related functionality grouped together

**Additional Principles:**
- **ACID:** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability in task execution
- **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself - shared abstractions
- **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid - minimal complexity
- **YAGNI:** You Aren't Gonna Need It - only implement what's necessary

#### 3.2 Rust-Specific Advantages

**Zero-Cost Abstractions:**
- Compile-time task scheduling optimization
- Monomorphization of generic task types
- Inlined critical path operations

**Memory Safety:**
- Ownership-based resource management

#### 4.2 API Design

**Unified Runtime API:**
```rust
// Unified executor for hybrid workloads
let moirai = Moirai::builder()
    .worker_threads(8)
    .async_threads(4)
    .enable_distributed() // Enable cross-process/machine communication
    .build();

// Async task execution
moirai.spawn_async(async { /* async work */ }).await;

// Parallel task execution
moirai.spawn_parallel(|| { /* CPU-intensive work */ });

// Cross-process task execution
moirai.spawn_remote("worker-node-1", || { /* remote work */ }).await;

// Universal communication - same API regardless of location
let (tx, rx) = moirai.channel::<String>();
tx.send_to("process-2", "Hello").await?; // Cross-process
tx.send_to("thread-local", "Hi").await?; // Same thread
tx.send_to("remote:192.168.1.100", "Hey").await?; // Remote machine

// Hybrid pipeline with distributed stages
moirai.pipeline()
    .async_stage(|data| async move { /* I/O */ })
    .parallel_stage(|data| { /* CPU */ })
    .remote_stage("gpu-cluster", |data| { /* GPU compute */ })
    .execute(input_stream)
    .collect();
```

**Iterator Integration:**
```rust
// Parallel iterator processing
data.into_par_iter()
    .map(expensive_computation)
    .async_then(|item| async_io_operation(item))
    .collect();
```
