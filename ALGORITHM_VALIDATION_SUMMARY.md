## Conclusion

All core algorithms in Moirai have been validated against well-established literature-based solutions. The implementations follow the proven designs while adding Rust-specific optimizations for memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. Performance characteristics match or exceed the theoretical bounds established in the literature.

### Design Principles Adherence

- **SSOT**: Single implementation of each algorithm, reused across modules
- **SOLID**: Each algorithm has single responsibility with clean interfaces
- **CUPID**: Composable algorithms that work together seamlessly
- **GRASP**: Information expert pattern - algorithms own their data
- **ACID**: Atomic operations with consistency guarantees
- **Zero-Copy**: Extensive use of borrowing and reference-based APIs
- **Zero-Cost**: All abstractions compile to optimal machine code

The combination of these validated algorithms provides Moirai with industrial-strength concurrency primitives suitable for production use.
