    /// If so, the returned [`Connection`] can be used to send application data without waiting for
    /// the rest of the handshake to complete, at the cost of weakened cryptographic security
    /// guarantees. The returned [`ZeroRttAccepted`] future resolves when the handshake does
    /// complete, at which point subsequently opened streams and written data will have full
    /// cryptographic protection.
    ///
    /// ## Outgoing
    ///
    /// For outgoing connections, the initial attempt to convert to a [`Connection`] which sends
    /// 0-RTT data will proceed if the [`crypto::ClientConfig`][crate::crypto::ClientConfig]
    /// attempts to resume a previous TLS session. However, **the remote endpoint may not actually
    /// _accept_ the 0-RTT data**--yet still accept the connection attempt in general. This
    /// possibility is conveyed through the [`ZeroRttAccepted`] future--when the handshake
    /// completes, it resolves to true if the 0-RTT data was accepted and false if it was rejected.
    /// If it was rejected, the existence of streams opened and other application data sent prior
    /// to the handshake completing will not be conveyed to the remote application, and local
    /// operations on them will return `ZeroRttRejected` errors.
    ///
    /// A server may reject 0-RTT data at its discretion, but accepting 0-RTT data requires the
    /// relevant resumption state to be stored in the server, which servers may limit or lose for
    /// various reasons including not persisting resumption state across server restarts.
    ///
    /// If manually providing a [`crypto::ClientConfig`][crate::crypto::ClientConfig], check your
    /// implementation's docs for 0-RTT pitfalls.
    ///
    /// ## Incoming
    ///
    /// For incoming connections, conversion to 0.5-RTT will always fully succeed. `into_0rtt` will
    /// always return `Ok` and the [`ZeroRttAccepted`] will always resolve to true.
    ///
    /// If manually providing a [`crypto::ServerConfig`][crate::crypto::ServerConfig], check your
    /// implementation's docs for 0-RTT pitfalls.
    ///
    /// ## Security
    ///
    /// On outgoing connections, this enables transmission of 0-RTT data, which is vulnerable to
    /// replay attacks, and should therefore never invoke non-idempotent operations.
    ///
    /// On incoming connections, this enables transmission of 0.5-RTT data, which may be sent
    /// before TLS client authentication has occurred, and should therefore not be used to send
    /// data for which client authentication is being used.
