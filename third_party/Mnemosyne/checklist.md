- [x] [patch] Document the `realloc` slow-path copy-length contract on both `Mnemosyne` and `MnemosyneAllocator<P, B>`: copy is `min(layout.size(), new_size)` because the bytes beyond `layout.size()` are size-class slack the user never initialized.
- [x] [patch] Add `test_realloc_does_not_copy_past_layout_size` regression test that writes a sentinel into the 8-byte slack window of an 8 B → 16 B class-0 allocation, performs cross-class realloc, and asserts the slack pattern does not propagate into the new allocation.

- [x] [patch] Mark `realloc_copy_grow<A: GlobalAlloc>` as `#[inline(always)]` so cross-class realloc slow paths keep monomorphized `alloc`/`dealloc` calls at the call site.
- [x] [patch] Refresh realloc and allocator-cycle Criterion rows after the retained realloc helper inlining change.
- [x] [patch] Regenerate `allocator_comparison.md` and run `benchmark_summary --release -- --enforce-thresholds` after the retained change.

- [x] [minor] Sprint C: Add `mnemosyne-c-shim` crate exposing `malloc`/`free`/`calloc`/`realloc`/`aligned_alloc`/`posix_memalign`/`malloc_usable_size` as `extern "C"` with `lib` + `cdylib` crate types.
- [x] [minor] Sprint C: Document the C-vs-Rust realloc copy-length distinction (`min(usable_size, new_size)` for C, since C tracks no requested size) in the shim module docs.
- [x] [minor] Sprint C: Add 11 shim regression tests covering alignment, zero-size, overflow, realloc grow/null/zero, and posix_memalign validation.
- [x] [patch] Reject deferred process-wide cross-thread reclaim telemetry after focused Criterion rows showed no stable small-handoff improvement and regressions in medium handoff plus threaded small allocation cycles.
- [x] [patch] Reject `#[inline(always)]` on `Page::reclaim_thread_free` after a refreshed `Threaded small allocation cycles/Mnemosyne` row regressed to about `16.528 us`.
- [x] [patch] Reject `#[inline(always)]` on exported `mnemosyne_local::usable_size` after focused Criterion rows regressed allocator cycle latency, combined usable-size latency, and raw usable-size query latency.
- [x] [patch] Reject `thread_alloc_layout_small` after focused Criterion rows improved allocation-only small latency to about `12.057 ns` and saturated threaded cycles to about `72.657 us`, but regressed the retained small allocation cycle to about `5.574 ns` and historical threaded small cycles to about `8.650 us`.
- [x] [patch] Serialize backend telemetry tests with a crate-local mutex so process-wide relaxed mapping counters are not compared while sibling tests mutate them.
- [x] [patch] Reject compact `Page` counter layouts (`u16/u8` and `u32`) after both preserved a 48-byte metadata budget but regressed saturated threaded cycles (`~101.720 us` and `~114.240 us`) and/or usable-size latency.
- [x] [patch] Keep `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE = 16` as the single source for the first size-class stride and small-allocation alignment ceiling; remove the stale compact-counter width assertions after compact counters were rejected.

- [x] [patch] Add `crates/mnemosyne-c-shim/include/mnemosyne.h` C declaration header matching the seven exported `extern "C"` symbols, documenting per-function null/zero/overflow/alignment contracts; reference it from README highlight #13.
- [x] [minor] Sprint C: Add dynamic interposition C demo (`examples/interpose_demo.c`) and dynamic verification build scripts (`run_demo.sh` for Unix, `run_demo.ps1` for Windows) to demonstrate dynamic linking and interposition ABI compliance.

- [x] [patch] Add `smallest_class_page_saturates_without_duplicate_or_early_refill` runtime witness: fill a 16-byte page to its 4096-block capacity, assert `alloc_count == max_blocks` with all-distinct non-null pointers, and confirm the next allocation refills a fresh page rather than returning a duplicate pointer from the full page.

- [x] [patch] Remove the redundant `layout.size() == 0` guard from `Mnemosyne::alloc` and `MnemosyneAllocator::alloc`; `thread_alloc_layout`/`is_valid_layout_alloc_request` already rejects zero-size, so the GlobalAlloc hot path now carries one fewer branch and one fewer copy of the zero-size contract.

- [x] [patch] Reject removing the `MAX_ALLOC_SIZE` predicate from `is_valid_layout_alloc_request`; the focused run improved `Allocator cycle latency/Mnemosyne/small/32` and `Usable size latency/Mnemosyne/small/32`, but regressed `Allocator allocation latency/Mnemosyne/small/32` and `Threaded small allocation cycles/Mnemosyne`.

- [x] [patch] Adopt `const {}` thread-local initializer for `ALLOCATOR_SLOT` (idiomatic stable form; emits the const-init accessor that omits the per-access lazy-init guard branch). Not benchmark-claimed — see gap_audit note on the contended local measurement environment.

- [x] [patch] Add a README "Research Foundations" section mapping each implemented mechanism (sharded free lists, page-local cross-thread queue, segment/page geometry, orphan adoption, decay-style reset, THP hint, guard regions, policy ZSTs) to its source paper/allocator, plus an honest performance-positioning paragraph and the small-alloc gap localization.
- [x] [patch] Reject Bitmap Free Lists for classes 0, 1, and 2 after Criterion small allocation cycles, realloc within-class, usable-size, and threaded allocation benchmarks regressed.
- [x] [patch] Reject Bounded Retention of Huge Mappings and per-CPU cache optimizations after allocator burst retention and threaded cycles regressed.
