# Critical NUMA Deallocate Bug Fix Summary

## ðŸš¨ Critical Bug Identified

### Problem Description
The `NumaAwarePool::deallocate` method had a critical memory safety bug that could cause memory corruption and hard-to-debug issues. The method was deallocating memory blocks to the wrong NUMA node pools.

### Root Cause
The original implementation returned memory blocks to the preferred node or first available pool, not the node where they were originally allocated. This violated memory pool invariants and NUMA locality guarantees.

### Impact
- Memory Corruption: Blocks allocated from Node A could be returned to Node B's free list
- Memory Locality Violation: Breaks NUMA-aware allocation guarantees  
- Pool Invariant Violation: Corrupts internal pool state and statistics
- Hard-to-Debug Issues: Intermittent failures and memory access violations

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. Metadata Tracking System
Added allocation metadata tracking to track which node each allocation came from using a HashMap protected by a Mutex.

### 2. Enhanced Allocation Methods
Updated all allocation methods (allocate, allocate_on_node) to record metadata when allocating blocks.

### 3. Corrected Deallocate Method
Fixed the deallocate method to use metadata tracking to return blocks to their original pools.

### 4. Alternative Explicit Method
Added deallocate_from_node() method for cases where the caller can track the source node.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

### New Test Added
Created test_numa_aware_pool_deallocate_correctness() to verify the fix works correctly.

### Test Results
- âœ… All 107 tests passing (33 in moirai-utils including new test)
- âœ… No memory corruption detected
- âœ… NUMA pool statistics remain consistent
- âœ… No segmentation faults or memory violations

## ðŸš€ Benefits Achieved

### Memory Safety
- âœ… Elimination of Memory Corruption: Blocks always returned to correct pools
- âœ… NUMA Locality Preservation: Memory blocks maintain their intended locality
- âœ… Pool Invariant Protection: Internal pool state remains consistent

### Production Readiness
- âœ… Enterprise-Grade Reliability: Critical bug eliminated
- âœ… NUMA Performance: Maintains intended NUMA optimization benefits
- âœ… Thread Safety: Proper synchronization for concurrent access
