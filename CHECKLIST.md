## Development Principles Checklist

### CUPID Compliance
- [ ] **Composable:** Components can be combined flexibly
- [ ] **Unix Philosophy:** Each module does one thing well
- [ ] **Predictable:** Consistent behavior across components
- [ ] **Idiomatic:** Follows Rust conventions
- [ ] **Domain-centric:** Focused on concurrency needs

### SOLID Compliance
- [ ] **Single Responsibility:** Each module has one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed:** Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **Liskov Substitution:** Implementations are interchangeable
- [ ] **Interface Segregation:** Clients depend only on used interfaces
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Additional Principles
- [ ] **DRY:** No code duplication
- [ ] **KISS:** Simple, understandable design
- [ ] **YAGNI:** Only implement what's needed
- [ ] **ACID:** Reliable task execution guarantees
