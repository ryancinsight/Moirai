# Moirai Development Checklist

- [x] [patch] Refresh the exact Mnemosyne provider revision and verify workspace
  clippy plus canonical nextest.
- [x] [patch] Consolidate direct and transitive Melinoe dependencies to one
  exact Git source identity.
- [x] [patch] Preserve SPSC send-before-close ordering with a value-semantic
  drain regression that contains no wall-clock synchronization.
- Evidence: workspace Clippy is warning-clean; canonical nextest passes 722/722
  tests with six configuration skips; `cargo tree -d` reports no duplicate
  Melinoe source identities.

## Phase 28: Melinoe executor capability migration

- [x] [major] Construct Melinoe's validated `ParallelExecutor` next to the real
  Moirai scheduler bridge with an explicit exact-once, completion, and lifetime
  safety proof.
- [x] [major] Remove the raw function-pointer registration call and update the
  workspace Melinoe contract to 0.9.0 and Mnemosyne facade to 0.3.0.
- [x] Verify the real Melinoe routing path plus Moirai executor Clippy, 83/83
  nextest (one cfg-gated test skipped), doctests, and rustdoc against Melinoe
  `bb07447`, Themis `6140468`, and Mnemosyne 0.3.0 at `df2994f`.

## Phase 27: GPU pollster boundary removal
- [x] [patch] Added `moirai_executor::block_on` as the Moirai-owned
  current-thread parking wait primitive for synchronous async boundaries.
- [x] [patch] Replaced `moirai-gpu`'s `GpuTaskAdapter` `pollster::block_on`
  call with `moirai_executor::block_on` and removed `pollster` from the
  `wgpu-backend` feature dependency list.
- [x] [patch] Added a benchmark source contract that rejects reintroducing
  `pollster` into `moirai-gpu`'s manifest or task adapter.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly rustfmt --edition 2021
  moirai-executor\src\lib.rs moirai-gpu\src\task.rs
  benchmarks\tests\benchmark_contracts\source_contracts.rs`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-gpu --features wgpu-backend`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --no-default-features`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo tree -p moirai-gpu --features wgpu-backend -i
  pollster` reports no matching package; `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run
  -p moirai-benchmarks gpu_task_adapter_uses_moirai_block_on_not_pollster
  --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 1/1.

## Phase 26: Socket stale-wake regression ✅
- [x] [patch] Added a real loopback TCP regression for the July 2 stale-wake
  async bug: `timeout(stream.read(...))` completes through the timer while the
  socket read waker remains registered, then peer readability wakes the stale
  reactor slot after the async task has completed.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-async
  timeout_read_stale_socket_wake_does_not_repoll_completed_task
  --status-level fail --no-fail-fast`.

## Phase 25: Transport stale export cleanup
- [x] [patch] Removed `moirai_transport::core_zero_copy`, a stale re-export of
  deleted `moirai_core::communication::zero_copy`, so Atlas consumers compile
  against the current `moirai_core::communication` surface.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-transport --check`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-transport`.

## Phase 24: Stateful Chunk Parallel Provider API ✅
- [x] [patch] Added `moirai_parallel::for_each_chunk_mut_with_state` so
  consumers can run mutable chunk kernels with one reusable scratch state per
  scheduled worker shard.
- [x] [patch] Re-exported the API from `moirai-parallel` and covered it with a
  value-semantic test that proves every chunk is written from reusable state.
- [x] [patch] Added `for_each_chunk_triple_mut_enumerated_with` and
  `for_each_chunk_quad_mut_enumerated_with` for provider-owned fused updates
  across three or four equal-length mutable output buffers.
- [x] [patch] Re-exported the multi-output chunk APIs and covered them with
  value-semantic tests that prove chunk indices and all output buffers are
  written from the caller-provided closure.
- Evidence: `cargo fmt -p moirai-parallel --check`; `cargo check -p
  moirai-parallel`; `cargo nextest run -p moirai-parallel
  for_each_chunk_ --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` (6/6).

## Phase 23: Task Registry Stable Slot Access ✅
- [x] [patch] Kept `TaskStateBlock` slot storage private behind
  `UnsafeCell`-based `get`/`insert`/`clear`/`states` methods so lifecycle
  tokens receive stable `NonNull<TaskState>` pointers without exposing block
  internals.
- [x] [patch] Routed registry production paths, diagnostics, active/completed
  counts, and cleanup through the block accessor API.
- [x] [patch] Updated benchmark source-contract assertions to pin the dense
  `UnsafeCell<Option<TaskState>>` representation and zero-allocation stable-slot
  invariant.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-executor --check`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --all-targets`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo clippy -p moirai-executor --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor` (61/61, 1 skipped);
  `rustup run nightly cargo doc -p moirai-executor --no-deps`.

## Phase 22: Sharded Task Registry ✅
- [x] [patch] Replaced the hybrid executor's single `Arc<Mutex<TaskRegistry>>`
  with `Arc<ShardedTaskRegistry>` so task registration and metadata reads route
  through per-shard registry locks.
- [x] [patch] Added sharded registry coverage proving dense global IDs,
  global-to-local metadata reporting, lifecycle-token completion, and unknown
  task lookup behavior.
- [x] [patch] Updated manager status/stat/wait paths to use the sharded
  registry facade directly and removed stale warning sources.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-executor --check`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --all-targets`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo clippy -p moirai-executor --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor` (62/62, 1 skipped);
  `rustup run nightly cargo doc -p moirai-executor --no-deps`; `git diff
  --check`.

## Phase 21: Executor Lockfile and Rustdoc Hygiene ✅
- [x] [patch] Synchronized `Cargo.lock` with the existing `cfg(loom)`
  `moirai-executor` dev-dependency so locked builds resolve the model-checking
  dependency edge.
- [x] [patch] Removed redundant explicit `WorkScheduler` Rustdoc link targets
  from `moirai-executor::hybrid`, keeping the package rustdoc gate
  warning-clean.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-executor --check`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo check -p moirai-executor --all-targets`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo clippy -p moirai-executor --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-executor`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo test --doc -p moirai-executor`; `rustup run nightly cargo doc
  -p moirai-executor --no-deps`; `git diff --check`.

## Phase 20: Async RwLock Waiter Map ✅
- [x] [patch] Completed the `moirai-async::sync::RwLock` waiter storage
  migration from `VecDeque` tuples to keyed `BTreeMap<u64, RwWaiter>` state.
- [x] [patch] Routed read/write future poll, cancellation, writer grant, and
  reader-batch wakeup through the same waiter state so the O(log n) removal
  contract compiles and preserves FIFO-by-monotonic-id handoff.
- [x] [patch] Fixed the `ConnectionId` Rustdoc peer-address link to
  `std::net::SocketAddr`, keeping rustdoc warning-clean.
- Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p moirai-async --check`; `rustup run
  nightly cargo check -p moirai-async --all-targets`; `rustup run nightly cargo
  clippy -p moirai-async --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; `rustup
  run nightly cargo nextest run -p moirai-async`; `rustup run nightly cargo test
  --doc -p moirai-async`; `rustup run nightly cargo doc -p moirai-async
  --all-features --no-deps`; `git diff --check`.

## Phase 19: Concurrent Stream Module Export ✅
- [x] [minor] Completed the `parallel_stream` -> `stream` module rename by
  exporting `moirai_iter::stream` from `moirai-iter`.
- [x] [minor] Renamed the stream extension trait and methods to
  `ConcurrentStreamExt` / `concurrent_*`, matching the bounded-concurrency
  contract rather than promising CPU parallelism for every async item future.
- [x] [minor] Added fused `concurrent_filter_map` and `concurrent_filter`
  stream adapters with value-semantic coverage.
- Evidence: `cargo fmt --check -p moirai-iter`; `cargo clippy -p moirai-iter
  --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; `cargo nextest run -p
  moirai-iter stream` -> 10 passed; `cargo doc -p moirai-iter --all-features
  --no-deps`.

## Phase 18: Default Provider Feature Contract
- [x] [patch] Added default `parallel` and `mnemosyne-memory` features to every
  Moirai package. Existing Mnemosyne-backed crates forward `mnemosyne-memory`
  to the established `mnemosyne` provider feature; non-provider leaf crates use
  zero-dependency markers.
- [x] [patch] Applied rustfmt-required import/closure formatting in existing
  Moirai iterator/reactor files so the formatting gate is clean.
- Evidence: `cargo metadata --no-deps --locked --format-version 1`; full Atlas
  feature-policy metadata audit; `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`.
  Residual: compile/test gates were blocked before rustc by denied access to
  `target/debug/.cargo-lock`.

## Phase 17: Mnemosyne Worker Maintenance Integration ✅
- [x] Registered Moirai's global scheduler as Melinoe's `std` partition executor via pushed Melinoe commit `8140882`, so branded partition writes route through Moirai workers.
- [x] Added a value-semantic scheduler test proving Melinoe partition routing writes every branded cell exactly once through the registered Moirai executor.
- [x] Removed dead thread-local cache declaration from `moirai-core::pool::GlobalPool::get`; the active implementation uses the global pool path.
- [x] Added `mnemosyne` as an optional `moirai-executor` dependency and default feature.
- [x] Forwarded the top-level `moirai/mnemosyne` feature into `moirai-executor/mnemosyne`.
- [x] Routed idle worker-loop maintenance through `mnemosyne::Mnemosyne` defragmentation sweeps using the provider's top-level backend selector.
- [x] Updated Moirai's Mnemosyne pin to `938d0c2bc094d3bbe7745d68d60e05a531e0cfc2` so the executor consumes the exported provider selector.
- [x] Verification: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p moirai --locked`; `cargo test -p moirai-executor --features mnemosyne --locked`; `cargo clippy -p moirai-executor -p moirai --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings`.
- Evidence: compiler diagnostics, value-semantic scheduler/executor tests under the Mnemosyne feature, and clippy diagnostics.

## Phase 16: Default Parallel Branding Integration ✅
- [x] Enabled `moirai-parallel` Mellinoe integration by default so the parallel crate exposes branded partitioning without opt-in feature plumbing.
- [x] Added `melinoe` to the `moirai` facade default feature set alongside existing `parallel` and `mnemosyne` defaults.
- [x] Replaced serial async iterator map/filter/for_each execution with bounded concurrent polling while preserving ordered map/filter results.
- [x] Verification: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo test -p moirai-iter execution::tests::async_context --locked`; `cargo test -p moirai-parallel -p moirai --locked`; `cargo clippy -p moirai-iter -p moirai-parallel -p moirai --all-targets -- -D warnings`; `cargo test --locked --workspace --examples`.
- Evidence: value-semantic async ordering tests, Mellinoe partitioning tests under default features, clippy diagnostics, and workspace example execution.
